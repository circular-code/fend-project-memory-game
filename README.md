# Memory Game Project

## Instructions

Hi all,
welcome to the fontawesome memory game!

In this puzzle game you can match youre favourite font awesome icons with the class-alternatives you need to write in your html or js to apply the icons.

If you play this for a few rounds you will get a good overview over what kind of icons exists and how they are named. Have fun playing!

How to play:
Open a card by clicking on it. You will either see a fontawesome image, or its counter part, the fontaweseme class. You can click on another card to try to find your cards counterpart. Try to get all the matches to beat the game! Each iteration you will be presented a randomly pulled icon set from the font awesome library. Just to make sure they will be mixed randomly aswell so you can't cheat ;).

The game displays a star rating (from 1-3) that reflects your performance. At the beginning of a game, it display 3 stars. After some 35 moves, it will change to a 2 star rating. After a few more moves, it will change a 1 star rating.
You should try to finish the puzzle as quick as possible to get a good rating. Also as soon as you start opening a card, a timer will keep track of how long you actualy took to beat the game, and also how many moves it took you. If you struggle with the current icons, you may reset the game by klicking the reload button to the top right.

Have fun playing.

## Dependencies
This game is semi dependent on the google fonts api. Semi dependant because the app still works with a fallback sans-serif font, if the google fonts api can not be reached.
